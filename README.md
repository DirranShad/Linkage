~~__Test it out [here!](http://dirranshad.github.io/Linkage "Linkage")__~~ - This link no longer works, as it redirects to the master branch. Even if it did work, many features in the chrome extension version would be extremely buggy/not work online. To properly demo this version of Linkage, you must add it as an extension to Google Chrome.
